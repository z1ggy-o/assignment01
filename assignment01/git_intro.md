# A Short Introduction to Git

## What is git?

Git may be the most popular distributed version control system in the world.
It is created by Linus Torvalds for development of the Linux kernel.

Next, let's briefly tak about the Version Control System and the features of Git.

### Git is a distributed version control system
#### What is a version control system and why we need it?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
keep the 'history'

It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. 

if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. 

### Why distributed

## How git works?
the single point of failure that the centralized server represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they’re working on. If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose absolutely everything

they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.
