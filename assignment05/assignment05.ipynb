    "Convolution is an important operations in image processing, and usually \n",
    "is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "An image actually is an array of pixel values. If we regart it as a continuous function of spatial coodinates, this function is the brightness of light impinging onto the camera sensor. Partial derivatives of this continuous function can be used to measure the edges of objects in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an edge is an abrupt change of image intensity, we change find the abrupt by computing the derivatives of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use *x* to represent horizontal, *y* to represent vertical. The *partial derivative* of function $f(x,y)$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial{f(x,y)}}{\\partial x} = \\lim_{\\Delta y\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x,y + \\Delta x)-f(x,y)}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial{f(x,y)}}{\\partial y} = \\lim_{\\Delta y\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x,y + \\Delta y)-f(x,y)}{\\Delta y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, we regart the image matrix as a continuous function, then each element of the matrix is the value of $f(x,y)$ and $\\Delta x$  ($\\Delta y$) is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the partial derivatives of the function is the substracion between two neighbor pixels. In this situation, *convolution* can help us to get the partial derivative matrix.\n",
